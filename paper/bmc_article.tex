\begin{abstract}
  % Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
\paragraph*{Background:}
Illumina Sequencing data can provide high coverage of a genome by relatively short ($\unit[100]{bp}$ to $\unit[150]{bp}$) reads at a low cost.
The base error rates in the reads vary greatly along the read sequence.
Low quality bases can be trimmed off or error-corrected.
Trimming, especially based on the quality scores, can eliminate large amounts of useful sequence in the reads.
Error correction is an alternative to trimming that takes advantage of the high coverage of the genome to make the high confidence base corrections in the reads.
Error correction allows for more effective use of the sequencing data thus reducing the coverage depth requirements in sequencing projects and increasing the quality of the resulting assemblies.
The vast majority of errors in Illumina data are substitutions, where a base call is incorrect.
Also, the sequence quality is usually higher on the 5’ end of a read and deteriorates toward the 3’ end of the read. Each base in the read has a quality score associated with it.
      
\paragraph*{Results:}
We propose a novel software, called QuorUM, for error correcting substitution error in second generation sequencing reads.
It provides accurate correction and is suitable for large data sets ($48$ billion bases corrected per hours on $48$ threads).

\paragraph*{Conclusions:} 
The QuorUM software is available under an open source license at \url{ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/quorum}.

\section*{Background}
\cite{blank}
While second generation sequencing technologies have progressed tremendously and offer ever longer reads with low overall sequencing error rate ($\approx 1\%$), correcting errors in sequencing reads remains an important prepossessing step in \emph{de novo} genome assembly.
In general, error correcting the sequencing reads leads to assemblies with longer contiguous sequences and fewer misassemblies.

As the quality of base calling usually degrades toward the 3' ends of reads, an obvious error correction method is to trim all the reads on the 3' end, either by a fix amount or based on the quality values reported by the sequencing machine.
Although this simple trimming scheme will reduce the number of erroneous bases, it still leaves many errors in the reads and needlessly throws away a lot of valid sequence.
Aggressive trimming results in fragmented assemblies.

On the other hand, trimming is an integral part of error correction.
The distribution of sequencing errors on the sequencing reads is complex and for some percentage of the reads, the sequence beyond a certain point contains too many errors to be corrected or, even worse, does not correspond to any sequence in the original genome.
It is important to trim those reads to avoid misassemblies.

% We need a paragraph or two on the various way to error correct: k-mer spectrum, alignment of reads, what else?

We propose a new error correction procedure and software package, named QuorUM (QUality Optimized Reads from the University of Maryland), that provides accurate trimming and error correction.
