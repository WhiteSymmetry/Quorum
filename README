Installation
============

1) Make sure that Jellyfish[1] is installed. One can download Jellyfish from:

http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/

2) Make sure that pkg-config has access to the configuration of
Jellyfish. Check with:

% pkg-config --exists jellyfish-1.1 && echo yes
yes

If nothing prints, see the README of Jellyfish. Also, make sure that
the program 'jellyfish' is in your path:

% which jellyfish
/usr/local/bin/jellyfish

Alternatively, one can set the variable JELLYFISH, JELLYFISH_CFLAGS
and JELLYFISH_LIBS to './configure'. See './configure --help' for
help.

3) Compile and install:

% ./configure --prefix=/my/dir
% make
% make install

Note that the installation directory (namely here /my/dir/bin) is set
in the quorum script. Quorum will NOT work if 'make install' is not
run.

Usage
=====

See 'quorum --help' for some help. Only the -s switch, specifying the
size of the Jellyfish hash is required. Hence, the following command
should be enough in the most simple case:

% quorum -s 50000000 input.fasta

The output will be in 'quorum_corrected.fa'.
